# Data Mining

The objective of the data mining team is to find or build datasets that can be used to analyze pedestrian safety in Newport.  Here's what to do:

1. Select a dataset that we need from the [crosswalk study trello board](https://trello.com/b/UwbBLEEO)
2. Search the [data portals](https://github.com/newportdataproject/data/wiki/Data-Portals) and the internet for applicable datasets, **OR** research information and build a dataset in a google sheet in [the data night folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TvMUONnDW_lS_k1KBzRMan_rhGJw_eqD?usp=sharing)
3. Share the dataset in  [the data night folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TvMUONnDW_lS_k1KBzRMan_rhGJw_eqD?usp=sharing) and link to it on the [crosswalk study trello board](https://trello.com/b/UwbBLEEO)



Google's Fusion Tables has a dataset search that will find existing structured data on the internet and load it into the tool.



We will be adding questions and datasets to the [board](https://trello.com/b/UwbBLEEO), so check back after you finish one set.
